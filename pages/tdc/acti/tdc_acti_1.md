The application for our lab is a basic Employee Records application with 1 million records. The application is written in Java, hosted by Apache, and underpinned by an Oracle 11g database.

The databases for the Dev and QA instances of the application are delivered via Delphix [data pods](https://www.delphix.com/platform/data-pod){:target="_blank"}.
