We should now see the Twitter column present in our Employees table and in a Twitter field in our `Add Employee` form. We will also add a new employee to validate our new feature works.

### YOUR STEPS FOR THIS SCENE:

1. Click the `Dev Instance` tab
2. Click the `Dev Instance` bookmark to refresh (note: Do not use the browser refresh button)
3. Validate you see the new Twitter features (highlighted below)
4. Use the `Add Employee` form to add yourself to the Employees application. Just make up a Twitter handle, if you don’t have one. Specify ‘1’ for your Employee ID. Click ‘Add’ to complete the submission
5. Validate you see your new Employee record on the top row of the form.
